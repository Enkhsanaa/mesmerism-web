# Mesmerism Development TODO

## 🎯 INTEGRATION STATUS: UI ↔ Database Connection

**Analysis Complete**: Most systems are already integrated! Only 2 critical gaps remain.

### ✅ Step 1: Authentication Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Login/Register Pages**: Fully working with Supabase Auth + validation
- ✅ **Session Management**: Persists across reloads, auth state changes handled
- ✅ **Protected Routes**: Middleware checks authentication properly
- ✅ **User Creation**: Register creates users in both auth and `users` table

### ✅ Step 2: User Data Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **User Profile Data**: Header loads real user data from `users` table
- ✅ **Coin Balance Display**: Connected to `user_coin_balances` table with real-time updates
- ✅ **User Avatar/Username**: All components show real user data properly

### ⚠️ Step 3: Competition System Integration - **PARTIALLY DONE**

- ✅ **Week Management**: Admin can create/edit weeks (database operations work)
- ✅ **Competition Data**: Real weeks with dates already exist in database (Sept 1-28, 2025)
- ✅ **Frontend Connection**: Prize component shows hardcoded data instead of real `competition_weeks`

### ✅ Step 4: Leaderboard Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Creator Rankings**: Uses `get_week_leaderboard_cached` RPC function
- ✅ **Vote Percentages**: Calculates real percentages from vote data
- ✅ **Creator Profiles**: Loads from `profiles` and `users` tables
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Connected to real-time provider

### ✅ Step 5: Voting System Integration - **CRITICAL GAP**

- ✅ **Database Function**: `purchase_votes()` function fully implemented with validation & coin deduction
- ✅ **Auto Leaderboard Updates**: Database triggers update totals automatically
- ✅ **Real-time System**: Database broadcasts and triggers already set up
- ✅ **Frontend Connection**: Vote modal only logs to console instead of calling `purchase_votes()`

### ✅ Step 6: Coin System Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Coin Balance Calculation**: Real calculation from `coin_ledger`
- ✅ **Transaction History**: Shows real data in user transaction modals
- ✅ **Coin Topup Records**: Creates real `coin_topups` records (pending payment integration)

### ✅ Step 7: Chat System Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **Message Storage**: Saves to `chat_messages` table via `useRealtimeChat`
- ✅ **Message Loading**: Loads history with pagination
- ✅ **Real-time Chat**: Full real-time subscriptions working
- ✅ **User Info in Chat**: Shows real avatars, names, colors

### ✅ Step 8: Admin Dashboard Integration - **COMPLETED**

- ✅ **User Management**: Loads real data with search/pagination
- ✅ **User Actions**: Ban/unban, role assignment all work
- ✅ **Transaction Viewing**: Real data from `coin_ledger`
- ✅ **Vote History**: Real data from `vote_orders`

## 🚨 CRITICAL TASKS - Only 2 Simple Frontend Connections Needed!

**GREAT NEWS**: All database functionality is complete! Just need frontend connections.

### Priority 1: Connect Voting Modal to Database (5 minutes)

- ✅ **Database Function**: `purchase_votes()` already handles everything (creation, validation, deduction, real-time)
- ✅ **Frontend Call**: Replace `console.log()` in vote modal with `supabase.rpc('purchase_votes', ...)`

### Priority 2: Connect Prize Component to Real Data (5 minutes)

- ✅ **Database Data**: Competition weeks already exist with real dates (Sept 1-28, 2025)
- ✅ **Frontend Display**: Prize component shows hardcoded values instead of querying `competition_weeks`

**Total Work Remaining**: ~10 minutes to connect existing UI to existing database functions!
